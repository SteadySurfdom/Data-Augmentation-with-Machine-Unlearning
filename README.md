## 🔍 Overview

Machine unlearning aims to selectively erase the influence of specific training classes from a model **without full retraining**, which is often computationally expensive.  
While the field has explored unlearning methods extensively, **the impact of audio data augmentation on unlearning dynamics has remained unstudied** — until now.

This work provides the **first large-scale, multi-model, multi-method investigation** of how standard audio augmentations affect both unlearning performance and collateral damage on retained data.

## 📌 Key Contributions

- **First comprehensive study** of the interaction between **audio data augmentation** and **machine unlearning**.
- Evaluated **9 state-of-the-art unlearning methods** across **6 augmentations**, **4 datasets**, and **6 evaluation metrics**.

  - **ResNet-18**  
- Provide **baseline unlearning benchmarks** (no augmentation) for **8 total models**, including:  
  - AST {Tiny, Small, Base}  
  - AudioMamba {Tiny, Small}

## 📊 Results Summary (High-Level)

- Augmentations **reduce entropy** of the output distribution on *retain* and *test* sets → models become **more confident**.  
- Entropy on *forget* sets **increases**, indicating **higher uncertainty and stronger forgetting behavior**.  
- Some unlearning methods (e.g., UNSIR, SSD) show **sensitivity to augmentation**, while others (e.g., Fisher, Bad Teacher) remain relatively stable.  
- AST-Small generally achieves **better robustness–forgetting balance**, while AudioMamba-Tiny shows **higher sensitivity** to augmentation noise.

## 🧩 Ablation Studies

### **Entropy Shift Analysis**
We compute Shannon entropy of softmax outputs across:
- Forget set  
- Retain set  
- Test set  

Data augmentation consistently:
- **Lowers entropy** on retain/test → stronger class certainty  
- **Raises entropy** on forget samples → better unlearning response  

This supports our claim that augmentations reshape the model’s confidence landscape in a way that improves selective forgetting **without retraining**.
